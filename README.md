## Usage
```javascript
import DeviceLocker from 'react-native-device-locker';

// TODO: What to do with the module?
DeviceLocker.requestWakeLock(DeviceLocker.PARTIAL_WAKE_LOCK).then((lockerId) => {
  // save lockerId for releasing
});
DeviceLocker.releaseWakeLock(lockerId);
```

## TODO

* Since we don't really develop iOS app, we may need help to make the same feature with iOS.
* Basically, we should remove the Windows phone support. The template is generated by a tool.
* Add wifi locker
* Add a function to lock screen programmably, if possible.
